# Student Support Agent

## Objective

Develop an intelligent Student Support Agent serving as the primary contact point for students seeking online course information. The agent delivers comprehensive assistance with course inquiries, enrollment guidance, payment options, scheduling, and support services.

## Input Requirements

### Query Categories

**Course Information**
- Course offerings and curriculum details
- Program duration and content overview
- Instructor information and course structure

**Enrollment & Prerequisites**
- Enrollment procedures and requirements
- Prerequisite validation and course switching
- Application process and documentation

**Scheduling & Timing**
- Course start dates and class schedules
- Session recordings and timezone options
- Program timelines and deadlines

**Payment & Financial**
- Pricing structure and payment options
- Payment plans and refund policies
- Financial aid and discount programs

**Support & Certification**
- Available support services and channels
- Certification requirements and processes
- Technical requirements and assistance

## System Architecture

### 1. Initialization
**Environment Configuration**
- Load environment variables and validate API keys
- Configure multi-provider AI model support (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Initialize knowledge base with course catalog and institutional policies

**Model Hierarchy**
- Primary: Gemini (Google AI Studio)
- Secondary: OpenAI GPT-4o
- Tertiary: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Automatic failover to available models

### 2. Query Processing
**Analysis Pipeline**
- Natural language query reception and intent analysis
- Context-aware processing for follow-up interactions
- Multi-tool information synthesis

**Available Tools**
- `get_course_information()` - Course data and descriptions
- `get_schedule_and_timing()` - Scheduling and start dates
- `get_payment_information()` - Pricing and payment options
- `get_support_services()` - Support channels and services
- `get_certification_info()` - Certification requirements
- `search_faqs()` - FAQ database search
- `get_enrollment_process()` - Enrollment procedures
- `check_prerequisites()` - Prerequisite validation

**Response Framework**
- Information synthesis from multiple sources
- Structured, comprehensive responses
- Professional tone with follow-up suggestions

### 3. Error Management
- Graceful handling of unrecognized queries
- Human support escalation protocols
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **AI Models:** Multi-provider support (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Architecture:** Modular Python design with type hints
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration test suite
- **Configuration:** Environment-based configuration management

## Sample Interactions

### Example 1: Course Inquiry
**Query:** "I'm interested in learning programming but I'm a complete beginner. What course would you recommend and how much does it cost?"

### Example 2: Enrollment Process
**Query:** "I want to enroll in the AI course. What are the prerequisites and when can I start?"

### Example 3: Payment & Support
**Query:** "Do you offer payment plans for the Data Science course? Also, what kind of support do you provide during the course?"
