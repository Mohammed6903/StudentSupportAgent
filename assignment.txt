About the Internship – Al Agent Developer
As an Al Agent Developer Intern, you'll help design lightweight, Al-powered workflows that
solve real-world education problems. This internship will assess your skills in automation
logic, tool usage, and prompt thinking
not full-stack development.
Objective
Choose a real-world scenario from the list below and build a basic design for an Al agent that
automates that task. The goal is to test your ability to break down a problem, define a logical
Al-assisted flow, and structure the solution using real tools and prompts.
Task Overview
You are expected to pick one use case and propose how you would build a lightweight Al +
automation solution for it. The focus is on clarity of logic, tool usage, and prompt engineering,
not a production-ready build.
Step 1: Choose ONE of the following scenarios
1. Student Support Agent
Answers common questions that a student might have about an online course
(timing, syllabus, payment, etc.).
2. Report Generator Bot
Takes basic inputs (e.g., quiz scores or survey responses) and drafts a 1-page
student report with strengths and improvement areas.

3. Outreach Assistant
Helps a small team reach out to 50 leads via email or WhatsApp by drafting
personalized messages using available data (e.g., name, interest, region).
4. Research Summarizer
Scrapes 3-5 links or articles on a topic (e.g., "Learning Styles in High School
Students") and creates a summary in bullet points.
Step 2: Design Your Agent
Structure your response in the following numbered format:
1. Agent Objective
A short description of what your agent is supposed to do.
2. Input
What inputs will the agent need? (e.g., student name, scores, links, questions)
3. Workflow
Explain your agent's process:
Ο How it will be triggered
Ο Step-by-step task breakdown
Ο
Which tools/APIs/services you'd use
4. Prompt Sample(s)
Share 1-2 example prompts you would feed into the LLM (OpenAl or others).
5. Output Example
Provide a mock output — such as a summary, message, or report the agent would
generate.
Guidelines
• Use numbered steps or diagrams - clarity matters more than polish
• Tools can include: Python, Google Sheets, Zapier, N8N, Notion, etc.
•
Full code is not required unless it's very short
•
Focus on logical flow, tool usage, and prompt structure
