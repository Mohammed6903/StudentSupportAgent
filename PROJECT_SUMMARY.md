## 🚀 How to Run

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Activate ADK environment
conda activate adk

# 2. Navigate to project
cd /home/mohammed/dev/Assignments/Scoreazy

# 3. Run offline demo (no API key needed)
python offline_demo.py

# 4. Setup API keys (optional for full functionality)
python setup.py

# 5. Run full agent (with API keys)
adk web
```

### Demo Options
1. **Offline Demo**: `python offline_demo.py` (shows tool capabilities)
2. **Interactive Demo**: `python demo.py interactive` (requires API key)  
3. **ADK Web UI**: `adk web` (full browser interface)
4. **Test Suite**: `python tests.py` (validates all functionality)
